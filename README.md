# PostIt

## Introduction

This is my attempt at learning Node.js and React, building a minimal social app call PostIt.

The tech stack is Node.js JavaScript, MongoDB for the backend, and React JavaScript for the frontend.

It has basic functionalities:

- User can sign up/sign in
- User can create text and image post
- User can search for post/users through the search bar employing MongoDB indexes
- User can follow another user to get their most recents posts
- User can comment on other posts for some basic communicating purpose
- User can edit/change their profiles, passwords, settings, ...
